## Finding the Killer Rabbit of Caerbannog

Python code to generate 3D point clouds from polygonal models, such that the polygonal model points will be occluded by the point cloud in any 2D projection. We first point sample the polygonal model, then surround the model in a point cloud such that the shape of the model is occluded in any 2D projection. We obscure our model-of-interest by repeatedly surrounding it with an amorphous cloud of points, giving the overall point cloud a structure of organic nature, like that of shrubbery.
