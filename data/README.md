The bunny.ply model is derived from the Stanford 3D Scanning Repository (http://graphics.stanford.edu/data/3Dscanrep/) originally developed by Turk & Levoy [1].

The teapot.ply model is derived from the Utah Teapot by Blinn and Newell [2].

The cow.ply model is derived from the Viewpoint Animation Engineering Cow described by Schroeder et al. [3] now packaged with OpenSceneGraph Data repository (https://github.com/openscenegraph/OpenSceneGraph-Data).
